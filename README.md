# Northcoders News API

## Instructions for connecting to Databases
  1. Create files `.env.test` and `.env.development` at   the root of the project.
  2. Within `.env.test` write `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`.
     Within `.env.development` write `PGDATABASE=nc_news`.
  3. Ensure that `.env.*` is present in the `.gitignore` file.

  This should allow you to connect to the correct databases and run the project locally.
